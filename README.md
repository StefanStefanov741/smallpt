# smallpt
This is a parallel programming project that uses the smallpt path tracing project by Kevin Beason as a starting point. For this project the path tracer is parallelized using different technologies such as  OpenMP, MPI, OPenCL, Pthreads and Vectorization. The results were also documented (time it took for the render).
